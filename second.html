<h5>Now I am describe about <span style="color:blue;"><h1>COVID-19</h1> <h2>Bangladesh</h2> </span></h5>
<P>
When we presented the early 2020 issue of the European Journal of Cultural and Political Sociology, no one comprehended what the outbreak of the novel coronavirus,<b> COVID-19 </b>, in Wuhan province, China, would mean to the world, to Europe, to any country or any single person in the weeks to come. <br>
A couple of months later, life as we knew it fundamentally changed. The mantras of today are ‘stay at home, stay safe’ and ‘social distancing’. Not even the most critical mind working on surveillance – and on what George Orwell grasped in his ‘1984’ novel – would have imagined that almost all over the world, nation states ban individual free movement and the gathering of people, while borders are closed and aeroplanes are <u> Normal social life and work has come to a halt</u>. It seems the policing of populations might be the ‘only’ way to stop the deadly virus spreading further–or at least slow it down to a pace our medical systems can handle. Ulrich Beck’s ‘risk society’ <span id="Fucka">appears to be taking on new forms in current times, while Simmel’s ‘psychology of the city dweller’ also seems to take on novel meaning.</span> The effects of the pandemic on social inequality, urban life, citizenship, migration, and core-periphery relations are already becoming visible, but will be only fully comprehensible in due course. What we have to face up to is unprecedented as far as contemporary generations are concerned, and will leave heavy marks, stigma, and perhaps trauma for those who survive the virus (but also for the lucky ones who are not being physically infected).</P>
